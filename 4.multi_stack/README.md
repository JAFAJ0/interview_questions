# multi type stack class

Use C to store many data types.

I am not super expert in C so i do lots of researches to do this. And I use  this [online_c_compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)

Based on my researching:

First construct an enum which include various types. Then struct union A to make a variable user input.

Then, use the multi type union struct to build a struct which compile with A. Add functions such as push, pop, peak, capitial size to maintain a stack.

To make such stack , one can store value or pointer.

In my opinion, the pointer 'array' way definately save memory but would let complex pointer operations.

There also ways to saves like store the datas in local files by io operations.
