# displayCountries

This reactJs project is for the second task:
1. The given API is broken and turned to be paid, so I use another instead.
2. Use npm install start to run this
3. the displaycountry file is an HTML with pure Javascript.
4. Pick whatever you like
## instructions
1. Go into this directory `cd Sarratings`
2. Run `npm install` to install packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the client side----It only have client side anyway

Use modern JavaScript and HTML5 to access information from the https://restcountries.eu/ API. 
The goal isto display a list of all the capital cities for the country and all of its neighbouring countries. E.g. Searching for“USA” will result in a list showing "Washington, D.C.", "Ottawa", and "Mexico City". 
Create a text box and searchbutton that will allow users to type in their search, and show the results on the page.
You may assume that you have access to all ES2017 features (e.g. async/await, spread operator), and donot need to make it compatible with IE11 or other legacy browsers. You may use libraries such as React, Vue,and Angular. Hint: if your solution queries a country with N neighbours, it should not then make N sequentialcalls to the API.
